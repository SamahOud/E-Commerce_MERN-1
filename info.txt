1. npm init -y

2. npm i express mongoose typescript

3. npm i --save-dev nodemon ts-node

    * nodemon is a utility that automatically restarts the Node.js 
      application when file changes in the directory are detected. 
      This is useful during development to avoid manually 
      restarting the server after making changes.

    * ts-node is a TypeScript execution environment and REPL for Node.js,
      which allows you to run TypeScript code directly without the need for compilation.

    * The --save-dev flag tells npm to save the packages as development
      dependencies in your package.json file. This means that these packages
      are only installed for development purposes and not required for the production environment.

4. npx tsc --init 
    * npx is a package runner tool that comes with npm (Node Package Manager). 
      It allows you to run packages that are not globally installed.

    * tsc is the TypeScript compiler.

    * --init is a flag that tells the TypeScript compiler to create a tsconfig.json
      file in the current directory.

    * The tsconfig.json file is a configuration file that specifies how the TypeScript
      compiler should compile your project. It includes options like the target
      ECMAScript version, module system, and other compiler options.

    * By running npx tsc --init, you're creating a new tsconfig.json file
      in your project directory. This file will contain the default configuration
      for a TypeScript project, which you can then customize according to your needs.

5. npm i --save-dev @types/express
